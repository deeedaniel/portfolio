        "Developed TwinMind's AI-powered web app serving 5,000+ active users for real-time transcription and summarization of meetings, lectures, and privacy-focused syncing using Next.js, Neon Postgres, and Amplitude for analytics. Created an AI chat powered by Portkey, integrating multi-LLM fallbacks for reliability and enabled streaming responses. Migrated backend-rendered shared memory pages into frontend-first architecture with caching and revalidating. Published React component library (GitHub + npm) with 90+ downloads, with automated CI/CD pipelines. Improved privacy with 'Private Mode' (client-side storage), resolved key bugs (broken deletions, missing fallback logic), and created product videos with 30k+ views.",
